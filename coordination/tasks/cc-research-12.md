# cc-research-12: R-12 Secure key storage per platform

Path: `coordination/tasks/cc-research-12.md`. Written by the orchestrator. This card plus the files under Brief are everything the agent receives (GAUNTLET.md 5.7).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Role | researcher |
| Component | research (Gate 1) |
| Orchestrator | claude-code |
| Model tier | standard (Sonnet, D-10) |
| Branch | none. Researchers write one file in the main checkout; the orchestrator commits it to `main` |

## Question
How should Command Library encrypt user API keys at rest on Android and Windows, and which libraries do that in each candidate stack?

## Feeds
GAUNTLET.md 2.H (API keys encrypted at rest, never logged or exported), 2.I (backup excludes keys). R-01 secure storage criterion.

## Candidate stacks (shared by R-01 and R-11 to R-15)

| ID | Stack | Android target | Windows target |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform. The fallback: Pat's known Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Navigation Compose, DataStore, Gradle setup, extended to desktop | Jetpack Compose | Compose for Desktop (JVM) |
| S2 | Flutter (Dart) | Flutter Android | Flutter Windows desktop |
| S3 | .NET MAUI (C#) | MAUI Android | WinUI 3 |
| S4 | Avalonia UI (C#) | Avalonia Android | Avalonia desktop |
| S5 | React Native + React Native for Windows | RN Android | RN Windows |
| S6 | Tauri 2 (Rust core, web UI) | Tauri mobile | Tauri desktop |

Depth: S1 and S2 in full depth. S3 to S6 deep enough to score them, or to rule one out with a sourced reason. Add a candidate not listed only with evidence that it could win the R-01 matrix, and say why.

## Scope (must cover)
- Android: Android Keystore system (key generation, hardware backing, StrongBox), Jetpack Security (EncryptedSharedPreferences) current status and any deprecation notice, Tink, and the current Google recommendation. Behavior across app updates, backups (Auto Backup and device-to-device transfer), and reinstall.
- Windows: DPAPI (CryptProtectData, user scope), Windows Credential Manager (CredWrite and CredRead), WinRT PasswordVault. Size limits, availability to unpackaged versus MSIX apps, and behavior for a JVM app.
- Per candidate stack S1 to S6: the libraries that wrap these (for example multiplatform secure settings libraries for KMP, flutter_secure_storage, MAUI SecureStorage, Avalonia options, react-native-keychain or equivalents, Tauri plugins). Platforms each supports, maintenance status, license.
- Threat model: what each approach protects against (other apps, device backup extraction, a stolen unlocked device, malware running as the user). State plainly what none of them protect against.
- How to exclude keys from app backups on Android and from the app's own backup file (GAUNTLET.md 2.I).
- Recommendation per platform and per leading stack.

## Brief (files to read, nothing else)
- `coordination/agents/researcher.md` (role brief, source of truth)
- this card
- `coordination/templates/RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/gauntlet/GAUNTLET.md`: sections 2, 3, 10 and Appendix A, for context only

## Working rules
- Write only `docs/gauntlet/research/R-12-key-storage.md`. Create it early and extend it section by section, so partial work survives an interruption. Do not commit; the orchestrator commits it to `main`.
- Do not change branches, stage, commit, or run any git command that changes state.
- Bash is for measurement only (`curl -sI` for sizes, `curl ... | gzip -dc | wc -l` for counts, `jq` on small JSON). Stream through pipes. Never save bulk files or any other file to disk.
- Network etiquette: send a descriptive `User-Agent` (for example `CommandLibraryGauntlet/0.1 (research)`) and `Accept` header to Scryfall, stay well under its rate limit, and download bulk data only from the bulk file hosts.
- Every claim carries its source URL and access date (today, from `date -u +%F`). Anything not confirmed by a source is written UNVERIFIED with what was tried. Never infer an endpoint, field, format, price, or capability.
- Terms and licensing get their own findings, quoting the relevant clauses.
- No em dashes anywhere in the file or the return message.

## Acceptance
- RESEARCH.md template sections present: question, findings, options, recommendation, risks, confidence.
- Every Scope item is answered or marked UNVERIFIED with what was tried.
- Every finding has a source URL and access date.
- Zero em dashes.

## Output
- `docs/gauntlet/research/R-12-key-storage.md`
- Handoff: none. A researcher writes only its research file (role brief). The orchestrator tracks status in this card and commits the file. A crash before commit loses only this card's run, which restarts from scratch.
